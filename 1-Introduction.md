 ## What is Database?
 
 - A DATABASE is a collection of data stored in a format that can be easily accessed, For managing this databases we uses a software that is DBMS(Database Management System)!
 - We connect the DATABASE to DBMS software for accessing or modifing the data.
 - The DBMS executes our instructions and sends results back.
 
 
 ### Several DBMS Softwares
 - Basically these several DBMS softwares divided into two parts-
   1.Relational Database Managemnet System
   2.Non-Relational Database Management System 
   
   
## 1. Relational DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
- IN Relational Database Management System, The data are stored in the form 'TABLE', where the data links to each other using relationship.
- That's why we called "RELATIONAL DATABASES".  
- Each table stores a specific type of Object/Data.
- Like `customer` ->`Orders` ->`Product`.

:black_nib:   For working with Database Management System we use SQL(Structure Query Language) to query or modifing our data.

### For Relational DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM we use-
     1.MYSQL
     2.SQL Server by microsoft
     3.Oracle
     
## :raised_hand_with_fingers_splayed: I wiil Learn here SQL with MYSQL.

## Non-Relational Databases
- Non-Relational Database sometimes reffered as "NoSQL(Not Only SQL)".
- In Non-Relational Databases, We don't have table or relationship.

##:raising_hand_man:  We all have a Question? :raising_hand_woman:
- SQL or SEQUEL? 
- Sometimes we pronunciate SQL to SQUEL :sweat_smile:

- Earlier SQL was SEQUEL 
- SQL stands for "Structure Query Language"
- SEQUEL stands for "Structured English Query Language" was Originated.
- SEQUEL changed to Acronyms "SQL".
